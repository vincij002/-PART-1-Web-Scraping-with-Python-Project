# Web-Scraping-Project-with-Python-Project
This is a repository for a web scraping project using python, upon finishing this project the results of this project will aide me with another project where I will create a predictive model using this information to predict who the winners of the soccer matches will be in the ITALIAN SERIA A league.

1. Download the data using a library called requests in python
2. We will parse the data using beautiful soup which will let us extract what we need
3. We will load everything into a pandas data frame so we can do data cleaning and get it ready for machine learning
