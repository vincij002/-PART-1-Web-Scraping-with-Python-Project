This repository contains the code for my Machine Learning Soccer project, which combines web scraping and predictive modeling using Python. In Part 1, I collected data from the internet for both the current and previous seasons of the Italian Serie A. This data serves as the foundation for Part 2, where I will develop a predictive model to forecast match outcomes with accuracy.

Part 1: Web Scraping Serie A Data

1. Download the data using a library called requests in python

2. We will parse the data using beautiful soup which will let us extract what we need

3. We will load everything into a pandas data frame so we can do data cleaning and get it ready for machine learning


Part 2: Develop a predictive model to forecast match outcomes with accuracy.

1. We are going to start with match data that we're going to load into pandas and clean.

2. We're going to apply a machine learning model called a random forest to predict who will win each match

3. We'll measure how well our algorithm did and improve the performance.

4. We'll end with some next steps that we can use to continue improving the model.
