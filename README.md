# Web-Scraping-Project-with-Python-Project
This repository contains Part 1 of a web scraping and predictive modeling project using Python. Upon completion, the results from this phase will serve as the foundation for Part 2, where I will develop a predictive model to forecast the outcomes of soccer matches in the British Premeir League.

1. Download the data using a library called requests in python
2. We will parse the data using beautiful soup which will let us extract what we need
3. We will load everything into a pandas data frame so we can do data cleaning and get it ready for machine learning
